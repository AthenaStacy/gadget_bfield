This is the set of Gadget2 routines (https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/) used for evolving smoothed particle hydrodynamics particles under the effects of gravity and thermodynamics.  Of particular note is that we have modified this code to also follow the evolution of magnetic fields attached the the gas particles as they move through the simulation box.
